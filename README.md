# grp_rating_forecasting
The objective of this study is to forecast GRP ratings for Indian Television Channel. Four different forecasting methods were used in this study and the results from each technique were analysed.

The data set used for this analysis consists of 3 fields: Date, week number and the GRP rating. Data points have a weekly frequency, starting from 7th June 2007 to 15th Mar 2009.

The data contains 92 points of GRP ratings for an Indian television network. The initial time plot of the data reveals that this is time-series data. 

The oscillations vary over time and therefore this is a non-stationary series. No outliers or missing values were identified in the data.

There is a clear and decreasing trend over time. There is also seasonal pattern in the data and any forecasts of this series would need to capture the seasonal pattern and the trend.
